In a recent incident investigation, I uncovered a brute force attack that targeted a user's account. The attacker, identified as "kali" with the IP address "192.168.56.101," initiated the attack at 11:48 AM on 09/07/2022. 
After multiple failed attempts, they successfully breached the account of "JSmith" at 11:56 AM.

Post-breach analysis revealed the attacker's interest in various commands, including "ftp," "get-process," "rdpclip," and "invoke-restmethod," possibly indicating data exfiltration intentions. Additionally, the attacker manipulated the "perl" application, setting traps for administrative users.

This incident emphasizes the importance of robust password policies, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and vigilant server monitoring in mitigating cyber threats. Proactive security measures are crucial in safeguarding against evolving risks.
